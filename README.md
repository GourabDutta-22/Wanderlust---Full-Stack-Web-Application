# Wanderlust---Full-Stack-Web-Application
Built a full-stack Airbnb-style web application using EJS and Express. Users can register/login, create property listings with image uploads, set location, price, and a short description. Implemented role-based access to restrict edit/delete actions to listing owners. Integrated local file uploads using Multer and Cloudinary, and added a GST toggle for dynamic pricing display. Comments and descriptions can only be added or modified by logged-in users with appropriate ownership.
